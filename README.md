  <h1>CPU Scheduling Simulation</h1>

  <p>This project is a CPU scheduling simulation that implements various scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF), Non-Preemptive SJF, Preemptive Priority, Non-Preemptive Priority, and First-Come, First-Served (FCFS). The simulation allows you to enter process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority, and then displays the Gantt chart, calculates the waiting time for each process, and the average waiting time.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Round Robin scheduling algorithm with a customizable time quantum.</li>
    <li>Preemptive and non-preemptive SJF scheduling algorithms.</li>
    <li>Preemptive and non-preemptive Priority scheduling algorithms.</li>
    <li>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm.</li>
    <li>Visualization of the Gantt chart for each algorithm.</li>
    <li>Calculation of waiting time for each process.</li>
    <li>Calculation of average waiting time.</li>
  </ul>
